Liberty Ridge Training Grounds LLC
Project Overview
This project is a website for Liberty Ridge Training Grounds LLC, a tactical training course founded and led by owner Zach Gaudette, a former army veteran. The website's primary purpose is to inform potential students about the self-defense and firearm training courses offered, with a phased rollout plan. The website's domain will be libertyridegetraininggrounds.com.

Phase One (November): The website will focus on promoting the initial, classroom-only courses covering firearm safety and unique personal firearm training. This phase will also include the integration of the High Level CRM platform to manage leads, automate communications, and streamline student sign-ups.

Phase Two (Upcoming): The website will integrate e-commerce functionality to sell tactical gear and accessories, with a specific focus on brands like Vortex and Sig Sauer.

Phase Three (Future): Once land is acquired, the website will be updated to include live firearm training sessions.

Design & Aesthetics
The website will embrace a patriotic and tactical theme, utilizing a core color palette of red, white, and blue. The design will feature clean lines, bold typography, and a professional, no-nonsense feel to reflect the serious nature of the training.

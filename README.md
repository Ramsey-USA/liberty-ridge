## 🎨 LR Theme Design System

The website implements the **LR Theme** - a professional black and white design system with strategic red/blue highlights:

### Core Principles

- **Pure Black & White Foundation** - Clean, professional aesthetic
- **Strategic Color Usage** - Red (#dc2626) and blue (#2563eb) for emphasis only
- **Roboto Typography** - Professional font hierarchy (Black 900, Bold 700, Medium 500, Regular 400)
- **Clean Geometry** - Minimal border radius (0-8px) and compact spacing
- **Professional Icons** - Only 🎯, ⚔️, 🛡️, 🎖️, 🏆 for training context

### Implementation

```typescript
// Example LR Theme component
<div className="bg-surface border border-border rounded-lg p-6 shadow-clean hover:border-patriot-red transition-all">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-text-primary mb-2">Professional Title</h3>
  <p className="text-text-secondary">Content with proper contrast and typography</p>
  <button className="btn-primary">Strategic Red CTA</button>
</div>
```

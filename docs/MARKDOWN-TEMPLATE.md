like commas, conjunctions, or logical breaks to maintain the 120-character limit
while preserving readability and meaning.

1. Use proper list formatting with blank lines
2. Keep headings consistent
3. Add blank lines around code blocks
4. End with proper trailing newline

  method(): void;
}
```

```bash
# Bash command example
npm run command
```

```text
Plain text example

Numbered lists follow the same pattern:

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
